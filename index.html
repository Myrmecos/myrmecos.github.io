                Hi! This is Nick, an undergrad studying Computer Science at HKU! <br> 
                Thank you for browsing my webpage - ̗̀ ෆ( ˶'ᵕ'˶)ෆ ̖́- <br>
                I'm currently working in Professor Chenshu Wu's lab as a student RA on privacy-protecting camera. <br>
                I have also done several small projects of online courses such as CS 61B, CS 61C, CS 162, 6S081~ <br>
                You can check out my github page for them!  ( •̀∀•́ )<br>
                <a href = "https://github.com/Myrmecos/">It's right here!</a>

                I used to work as a student RA at Professor Guenard's ant lab! <br>
                Though I'm no longer doing insects, I'm still really interested in any crawling critters! <br>
                I can say I'm quite familiar with Hong Kong's local ants, freshwater/mangrove/beach crabs, and somewhat familiar with common local birds. <br>
                Also, the name of my GitHub account means "ant" in Greek! <br>
                I have friends working in these area (｡･ω･｡) <br>
                If you are interested in taking a look at some HK's wild bugs, feel free to browse around the "Wild Stuff" section of my page! <br>
