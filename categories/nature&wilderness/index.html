                    <img class="creature" src="../../images/nat&wil/LongFuShan/oriental_house_gecko.jpeg">
                    <p>Very common gecko. Can be found along roadside railing and on concrete wall. You can find some individuals with fat tails. 
                        This is because the gecko can store nutrients in its tails (and therefore dropping a tail is very expensive for a gecko!
                        It is trading its fat storage for its life. Do not try to grab it or it may drop its tail). Additionally, you could tell if a tails is regenerated
                        by examining the color difference between the body and tail. A regenerated tail often has different color and patterns than the body.
                        The best place to find them is walls underneath lamp. There is a passenger walkway by Pok Fu Lam playground where there are many geckos waiting for bugs under lamp at night. 
                        The aggregated geckos would attract their predators, such as wolf snake in the genus <i>Lycodon</i>. You can find their eggs in empty drainage pipes.

                        One of the most iconic amphibian species in Hong Kong. It is endemic to the region and can be found perching on wet rocks near waterfall. Its enlarged toe pads ensures a firm grap upon the slipper rocks.
                        You don't have the toe pads so please be careful when approaching them near waterfalls (I have slipped more than once before). It is an endangered species (source: <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/58210/63852284">IUCN red list</a>). Please do not try to disturb or handle them.

                        Very very common. Poisonous and can produce toxic excretion via skin when it is stressed. 
                        You might try to touch it (many individuals are very calm) (but still not recommended as it scares the toad), 
                        but ensure that you have no sun lotion/whatever man-made chemicals on your hands to protect the toad. 
                        Wash your hand after touching it.
                        The Chinese name refers to the black rings around its eyes. Some individuals have distinct black rings, while others may not have very distinct rings.

                        A very common freshwater crab in Hong Kong's mountains. It is endemic to Hong Kong and some nearby Guangdong regions. This species prefers clear streams covered by trees.
                        The color is variable, from grayish-brown to bright red. They have assymetric claws, and the phenomenon is most pronounced in males (said to help attract mates, though seems to have no experiment evidence to date). 
                        In Shenzhen, the species is quite rare due to habitat loss and poaching (so do not try to buy a freshwater crab in fish market, as most individuals are wild-caught).
                        There is another cogeneric species, <i>N. aculatum</i> in Hong Kong. This species is rarer and cannot be found on HK Island. You can find them in New territory, and can tell them apart from N. hongkongensis by their blue-ish hue.
